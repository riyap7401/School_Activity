      At our inter-school debate competition, we won first prize. But, it was for a reason. We are home to many full-attended, bright, hard-working young students, that make things like this happen. We offer various debate camps & classes throughout our school campus time. If you are interested, spots are open, and we'd be happy to take you in. Keep in mind other students might want to do this too, so when the sign-up sheet fly out, get to them FAST.

           In our inter-school football competition, we won second place, thanks to a hardworking group of students, that made this achievement happen. As you can see, many of our students participate in sports ,and among those sports, football (Or soccer in places such as the US ) seems to be one of the most popular. Multiple schools offer opportunties like this, so of course there is going to be some hard players and or teams. Second is still better than third. If you are interested, please try out. A bigger team is a better team.

             When our inter-school science competition rolled around, we got a stunning second place. Groups of students were chosen to present their certain project. The students were given weeks of preperation, studying, and time. This accomplishment hopefully will be able to be carried on to the next generation of students. The " Science Fair " definetly seems to be a popular choice among this group of people. Sign-ups are out or coming out if you are interested. If other students like it, there is a chance you will too. Have fun. Make something useful.
